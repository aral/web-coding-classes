### (HTML) Attribute

> An **attribute** extends a tag, changing its behavior or providing metadata. An attribute always has the form `name=value` (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value).

```html
<input type="number" min="0" max="1" step="0.1" />
```

*This HTML code represents a form input field, that must contain a number from 0 to 1.
It iterates in 0.1 steps. `type`, `min`, `max` and `step` are attributes.*

### JavaScript (JS)

> JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages.
> Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

### Scope

> The current context of execution. The context in which values and expressions are "visible," or can be referenced. If a variable or other expression is not "in the current scope," then it is unavailable for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.

### TypeScript (TS)

TypeScript is a superset of [JavaScript](#javascript-js) that is compiled into plain JavaScript that can be interpreted by any browser.
TypeScript its self cannot be interpreted by browsers, so it is a kind of dialect of JavaScript.
A typical new feature is to *type-set* variables:

```ts
const foo: string[] // type-setting `foo` to an array of strings
const foo = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'] // setting value of `foo`
```
