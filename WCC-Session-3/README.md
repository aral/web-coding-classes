# WCC Session 3

This session will be a supervised hands-on of manipulating any webpage through a built-in [JavaScript](../WCC-Glossary/#javascript-js) [console](../WCC-Glossary/#console).
Most modern web browser do have such a console, which allows you to execute JS code on [runtime](../WCC-Glossary/#runtime) of the web application you have just opened.

## Opening the Developer Tools

Any modern web browser allows to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) which represents all parts of the web application or website as a tree.
You're having parent-child relationships inside the HTML code and rules for the styling with CSS and logic implemented inside the JS code.
The latter we want to tackle on this session.

So, open up the [developer mode](../WCC-Glossary#developer-tools) of your browser by hitting <kbd>F12</kbd> on your keyboard or by right-clicking any content and select something like „Inspect element“ (*mind that each browser has a different naming for that interaction*).
