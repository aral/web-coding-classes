# WCC Session 1

Welcome to the first *Web Coding Class* Session. 
If you're a total beginner and want to start coding, you'll find here much introductional information on how the Internet works, what happens in the background of your browser while you're browsing the web etc.
There is a huge demand on good web developers.
What basically is meant by „good” we will explain on a later session.
But, don't worry and go ahead or skip different sections or even whole session.
Every chapter holds a *questions and quests* section for your to dive deeper into the topics.
It's just a nice-to-have.
Feel free to skip them.

> **NOTICE**  
> Besides these Sessions there is an comprehensive [Glossary](../WCC-Glossary/README.md), which explains all that technical vocabulary. Most technical words will have hyperlinks to its explanation. Feel free to contribute a better description. This project is still under heavy development.

## Website Manipulation

> It's all visible.

Websites are simply programs, that run on servers (*many stacked computers, that are „always“ reachable in the web*) and can be opened by any web browser.
If you buy any program out their, except it's open source, you won't be able to look what's going up inside.
It's like buying a smartphone or laptop without any simple possibility to change the battery.
But websites are different, because a huge part of it's code is directly accessable.
So, you can have a close look on what's going up in there.

Let's make an example from „real world“.
Imagine you're wanting to buy a new chair from a carpenter.
So, you're sending a `Request` to the source of distribution, in this example the carpenter.
And you're getting a `Response`, in this case a chair.
In the web you're doing almost the same, but you're sending your `Request` to a server and getting back a bunch of text and data as a `Response`.
This `Response` does not include the whole chair, but its source code, some kind of construction manual to build the chair.
Gladly your browser is capable to read this instruction and interpret it.
So, you can see the the chair, but the instruction plan is still callable.
And the carpenter rarely gives information about his or her construction plans.
Websites are a great source of having both, the plans and the product.
Even other software is mostly just the product without any possibility of interacting with the plans.
Finally, we should have a look and inspect a web page:

```
1. Right-click any content in this web page.
2. Choose „Inspect“
```

You could also hit the <kbd>F12</kbd> key on your keyboard.
This opens the `Inspector` which lets you dive into a huge part of the code.

If you're curious, go ahead and try to manipulate any content. 
No worries, this is only [client-side](../WCC-Glossary/README.md#client-side), it's only locally on your machine changed.
You might also like to click through the different tabs.
There is a lot of information about the current state of that web page visible. 
In a later session we're going to have a closer look on this topics, but don't hesitate to play around.

### Questions

1. What are the most popular web browsers?
2. Which was the first graphical web browser ever?
3. In which language are the most web browsers developed?
4. Which short-cut is used to focus the [address bar](../WCC-Glossary/README.md#address-bar)?

### Quests

*For verification make a screenshot of your results. Remember, your changes are only locally and do not persist. After closing the tab, window or browser your changes are gone.*

1. Open any news website and change the headline into something funny.
2. Openy any online shop and change any image.

## Creating Accounts

> Web developers are not alone.

After a while you will see how huge our community is.
We're having our own „newspapers“, question-and-answer (Q&A) platforms and space to colaborate, present and discuss our projects.
And you're already right there.
This is `GitHub`.
It's *the place to be* for developers at all, not only web developers.

### GitHub

GitHub is a collaborative platform for hosting, sharing, discussing and maintaining code in a central point, so every involved person can investigate, search and read about others and his or her own projects.
You can use this platform to host you're own project and decide if it should be visible for the public audience.
If you want to code something privately just with your friends or co-workers, this is totally fine and possible.

<br><br>

Think about getting an account here.
Later on it will make things much easier, because all the source codes here are versioned with git, a massivly important piece of code to help to make code maintainable.

#### Questions

1. What are common alternatives of *GitHub*? Can you find some on the web and how do they differ from *GitHub*?
2. What is the business model of *GitHub*? How do they make money?
3. What is the most popular programming language used in the projects hosted on *GitHub*?

#### Quests

1. Create an account on *GitHub*.
2. Create your first [repository](../WCC-Glossary/README.md#repository).

### Stack Overflow

#### Questions

1. What are common alternatives to Stack Overflow?

#### Quests

1. Create an account on Stack Overflow.
2. Complete the [Beginners Tour](https://stackoverflow.com/tour)

### Hackernews

<br><br>

Hackernews is the daily „printed“ newspaper printed for developers over all division.
Every member can publish a link to an article found on the web.
Every other member can up or down vote it and discuss the content and intention of this article.
After the day, the list will be reset, so you only recieve the hottest topics every day.
There are more categories to choose from.
So, take a look and find out which categories are there.

### Quests 

1. Find the `noobstories`.
